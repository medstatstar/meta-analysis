## Purpose

Turn "I want to do a meta-analysis but have no topic" (or a candidate topic)
into an **auditable, output-driven decision**: should this topic be done, and
in which meta-analysis type — **before** any R analysis runs.

This module is the **upstream gate** of the skill. It does NOT compute pooled
estimates; it decides whether a topic deserves a full analysis, and pre-checks
methodological compliance.

## When to trigger

- "我想做 Meta 分析但没选题" / "I want a meta-analysis but have no topic"
- User offers a direction and asks whether it is feasible
- Reviewer rejected a topic as "duplicate / no increment" — need re-evaluation
- Before PROSPERO registration — methodological pre-audit
- User asks for a structured topic-selection report

**Not applicable**: user is already at data-extraction / pooling stage →
route to the normal analysis pipeline (Core Functions in SKILL.md).

## Dual path entry（双路径入口）

| User signal | Path | Output |
|---|---|---|
| "5 分钟告诉我能不能做" / "quick feasibility" | **Quick Assessment** | 1-page decision card: rough 4-dim scores + verdict + top risks (≤30 min) |
| "给我一份选题报告" / "PROSPERO 预审计" | **Full Assessment** | 5-stage workflow → 11-section report (`generate_topic_report.py`) |
| "被拒为重复了" | **Dedup re-review** | Increment re-review report (subset of Full: Stage 4 only + verdict) |

> Quick Assessment must NOT give a final go/no-go — it is a screen.
> If Quick returns ⚠️ or ❌ on any dimension → recommend Full Assessment.

## Four-dimension scoring model（四维评估模型）

Each dimension scored 0–5 with a **mandatory anchor reason** ("should be 4"
alone is NOT acceptable). Total 0–20.

| Dimension | 0–1 (fatal gap) | 2–3 (weak) | 4–5 (strong) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **临床价值 Clinical Value** | No clinical question / already answered | Marginal relevance | Answers a real decision (drug, dose, population) |
| **方法学可行性 Methodological Feasibility** | No estimable effect measure / impossible design | Loose PICO, few comparisons | Clean PICO, standard effect measures, feasible design |
| **数据可得性 Data Availability** | No realistic data source | Partial data, heavy reconstruction | Published summary data or IPD obtainable |
| **新颖性 Novelty** | Known duplicate | Incremental only | Fills a genuine evidence gap (verified by dedup search) |

### Score rules
- 总分 ≥17 → 强烈建议（strongly recommend）
- ≥14 → 建议（recommend）
- ≥10 → 暂缓（hold, fix gaps first）
- <10 → 不建议（not recommended at this time）
- **任一维 ≤2 → 一票否决（veto）**：无论总分多少，先解决该维缺陷再谈选题。

## Cross-check rules R1–R6（交叉检查规则）

Run after scoring; any rule **triggered** → force re-review of the flagged
dimension(s), output must state which rule fired and what was re-examined.

| Rule | Check | Trigger example |
|---|---|---|
| **R1** | Clinical value says high but PICO is coarse ("实体瘤患者" + "PD-1 抑制剂" whole class) | Score ≥4 clinical but PICO not decomposable to a drug/dose |
| **R2** | ≥3 interventions compared but meta type chosen is pairwise, not NMA | Multi-arm design + "pairwise" in report |
| **R3** | Novelty ≥4 but no dedup search evidence recorded | High novelty without PROSPERO/Cochrane/PubMed hits logged |
| **R4** | Methodological feasibility ≥4 but no pre-specified heterogeneity threshold / subgroup plan | Feasibility high, I² trigger (e.g. >50%) not pre-set |
| **R5** | Data availability ≥4 but effect measure inconsistent with outcome type (e.g. survival outcome → OR) | Availability high + mismatched effect measure |
| **R6** | Full assessment claims "recommend/proceed" but PROSPERO registration not mentioned | Verdict proceed + no PROSPERO step in next actions |
| **R7** | Candidate directions ranked by meta *type* (pairwise/NMA/regression) or by raw feasibility, **without** a real dedup screen — and a saturated/generic direction is listed as the top pick | Top candidate is "SGLT2i vs placebo on CKD composite endpoints" (a direction already covered by ≥5–6 large meta-analyses in 2024) with no evidence-gap justification |

## Meta type decision tree（Meta 类型决策树）

```
Compare interventions (≥3 arms, same outcome)?
 ├─ yes → NMA (netmeta / gemtc；multinma 可选)
 ├─ no → individual patient data available?
 │    ├─ yes → IPD meta (one-stage / two-stage)
 │    └─ no → dose-response relationship in scope?
 │         ├─ yes → dose-response meta (dosresmeta)
 │         └─ no → diagnostic accuracy question?
 │              ├─ yes → DTA meta (mada bivariate + SROC)
 │              └─ no → outcome type:
 │                   ├─ binary / continuous / survival / rate → standard pairwise
 │                   ├─ single proportion / prevalence → single-group meta
 │                   └─ genetic association / multivariate → specialized (esc / mvmeta)
```

Mapping to this skill's engines: see `advanced_analysis.md` (IPD /
multilevel / dose-resp / power), `bayesian_nma.md` (Stan/JAGS),
`diagnosis_meta.md` (mada), `single_group_meta.md` (metaprop et al.).

## Five-stage full workflow（完整评估 5 阶段）

Each stage has a **decision gate**; do NOT pass to the next stage until the
gate is cleared.

### Stage 1 — Research interest clarification
Ask: core interest, meta goal (thesis / journal / grant / learning), method
capability boundary, resource constraints.
- **Gate 1**: output 1–3 candidate directions. 0 → ask another round;
  ≥4 → ask user to shortlist 3.

### Stage 2 — PICO/PECO operational decomposition
See `pico-guide.md`. Every element must be expressible as a search term.
- **Gate 2**: self-check list all pass → Stage 3.

### Stage 3 — Four-dimension scoring + meta type selection
Score with anchors, run R1–R6, choose meta type via decision tree.
- **Gate 3**: total + veto rules applied; type chosen → Stage 4.

### Stage 4 — Dedup search + PRISMA/AMSTAR-2 pre-check
See `dedup-search.md` and `compliance-precheck.md`.
Three-layer dedup: PROSPERO → Cochrane → PubMed (last 5 years);
non-English scope → CNKI / 万方 / 维普 / SinoMed extension (user opt-in,
network note applies).
- **Gate 4**: dedup evidence + compliance risk 🟢/🟡/🔴 recorded → Stage 5.

### Stage 5 — Topic report generation
Mode A (recommended): `python scripts/generate_topic_report.py input.json output.md|html`.
Mode B: fill `references/topic-report-template.md` by hand.
If PROSPERO registration intended → include `prospero-mapping.md`.

}
```

Verdict mapping: `strongly_recommend | recommend | hold | not_recommended`
(+ `veto:<dimension>` suffix when a veto fired).

## Traps to avoid (13, distilled from reference skill + Cochrane guidance)

1. Never skip the dedup search in a Full assessment.
2. PICO must not be coarse; complex interventions decomposed to the drug/dose.
3. ≥3 interventions → NMA, not pairwise.
4. Pre-specify ≥3 subgroup analyses.
5. Pre-set heterogeneity threshold (e.g. I²>50% → subgroup/regression).
6. No unanchored optimistic scores — every score needs an anchor.
7. Run R1–R6 always in Full mode.
8. PRISMA 2020 item #16 (equity, PROGRESS-Plus) must be considered.
9. Verdict "proceed" must mention PROSPERO registration.
10. Distinguish near-duplicate vs exact duplicate (see `dedup-search.md`).
11. Non-English population → extend non-English DB search.
12. Quick assessment must not give a final verdict.
13. Outcome ↔ effect measure mismatch → block (see R5).
14. Candidate directions must be ranked by **evidence gap + novelty verified by dedup search** (R7), not by meta *type* or raw feasibility. Never list a saturated/generic direction (e.g. a broad "SGLT2i vs placebo on CKD composite endpoints" pairwise meta already covered by ≥5 large 2024 meta-analyses) as the top pick without an evidence-gap justification.
