> **No install needed for the basics:** if you don't want to install this skill and just want to try its core features quickly, use the web app directly at **https://meta.medstatstar.com**.

> **Easy-to-use R-based Meta-Analysis for Clinical Researchers**
>
> You don't need to code or memorize commands — just describe your meta-analysis needs in **plain language inside a chat**, and the skill **automatically runs** the full analysis (pooling, figures, report) for you. Powered by R and 14 core + 2 optional professional R packages (metafor, meta, netmeta, bayesmeta, dosresmeta, mada, etc.), it returns results in Chinese or English depending on your OS language setting (you can force-switch via a prompt at any time). Once you describe a request, the skill **auto-executes** and returns results + figures; ask for the full reproducible R code at any time.

## Who This Is For

meta-analysis is part of the CT-series skill family, built for three groups:

- **Clinical-trial practitioners at pharmaceutical companies** — sponsors, CROs, and medical / statistical / regulatory roles who need to pool and compare study evidence;
- **Clinicians and nurses who design, conduct, or participate in clinical research** and need meta-analysis / systematic-review support;
- **Medical students who want to learn evidence-based medicine and meta-analysis methodology in a structured way**.

---

## 1. How to Use It in a Chat (the Core)

meta-analysis is a **conversational skill**: you simply tell the assistant what you want in natural language — no commands, no parameter names to remember. As a WorkBuddy skill it **auto-loads with no extra installation**.

Below are 7 real conversational examples — **one per category** in the Scenario Index (§2): ① systematic-review workflow, ② pairwise meta, ③ heterogeneity & bias, ④ advanced models, ⑤ effect-size conversion, ⑥ visualization, ⑦ study quality. Each shows **"You say"** and a sketch of **"The assistant replies"**, plus how to get the actual number.

### Example 1 · ① Systematic review workflow: topic selection
**You say:**
> I'm interested in SGLT2 inhibitors for renoprotection and cardiovascular benefit in chronic kidney disease (CKD), but I haven't decided which specific meta-analysis direction to pursue. Can you help me shortlist candidate directions?

**Assistant replies (sketch):**
> Sure — I'll use a **topic-selection approach** to lock down the direction. First I run the **in-skill dedup probe (Cochrane + PubMed real hit counts)**, then shortlist — otherwise a saturated direction can be wrongly pushed as top pick.
>
> **First, rule out the saturated directions**: the generic "SGLT2i on cardiorenal outcomes in CKD" is Cochrane 23 / PubMed 2785 — highly saturated. **Counter-intuitively**, the seemingly niche **non-diabetic CKD (Cochrane 20 / PubMed 2402)** and **dialysis / advanced CKD (Cochrane 22 / PubMed 1067)** are also heavily covered (DAPA-CKD / EMPA-KIDNEY spawned many reviews) — also not recommended.
>
> Re-shortlisting 3 candidates by **evidence gap + novelty** (I'll produce 1–3 directions; I won't decide for you):
>
> **Candidate ① Renoprotection in IgA nephropathy (top pick)**
> - Cochrane 4 / PubMed 224 (≈1/10 of the broad direction) → **real gap**
> - Most common primary GN; SGLT2i already a guideline adjunct; many RCTs, data available
>
> **Candidate ② Net benefit / benefit–risk framework**
> - Cochrane 5 / PubMed 442 → gap
> - Pools renal + cardiac benefit with safety events (DKA / infection / volume depletion) in one framework — strong methodological differentiation
>
> **Candidate ③ Specific glomerular diseases (FSGS / membranous / ADPKD / lupus)**
> - FSGS Cochrane 0, ADPKD 2, membranous 1, lupus 3 → **very deep gap**
> - ⚠️ but sparse RCTs → power risk; better as a **scoping review** than a hard efficacy MA
>
> **Suggestion**: Start with ① (real gap, high clinical need); ② as the methodological-differentiation alternative; ③ conditional. Next step: a **full topic assessment** (PICO + dedup search + PRISMA/AMSTAR-2 pre-check), and **run ct-literature first for a full dedup confirmation** (the probe is a quick signal; FSGS=0 may include index-phrasing variance, don't rely on it alone).

**📌 Note:** When you have a direction but are unsure which specific meta to run, the assistant uses the topic-selection framework to produce **1–3 candidate directions + a 4-dim score + meta type**, instead of deciding for you or giving a single answer. This is the **topic-selection gate** before analysis — no R computation is invoked. Candidates are stratified by **evidence gap / novelty**, each backed by the **in-skill dedup probe (Cochrane + PubMed real hit counts)** — so a saturated generic direction (including the "intuitively niche" non-diabetic CKD or dialysis) is no longer mis-pushed as the top pick.

### Example 2 · ② Pairwise meta: two-group binary (most common)
**You say:**
> Combine the OR across these 5 binary studies:
> Study A: experimental 30/100, control 20/100
> Study B: experimental 45/120, control 30/100
> ...

**Assistant replies (sketch):**
> ✅ 5 studies, random-effects (DL), OR = 1.52 (95%CI: 1.18–1.96), I² = 34%
> (Ask for the full reproducible R code at any time.)

**📌 Auto-execution:** Once you describe the request, the assistant **auto-executes** and returns the real result; ask for the reproducible code by saying **"give me the full R code"**.

### Example 3 · ③ Heterogeneity & bias: I² + subgroup
**You say:**
> I did a continuous meta with 8 studies, SMD pooled, but I² is high — I want to subgroup by region

**Assistant replies (sketch):**
> ✅ 8 studies, SMD = 0.42 (95%CI: 0.15–0.69), I² = 78%
> Subgroup by region:
> - Asia (k=4): SMD = 0.55, I² = 45%
> - Euro-US (k=4): SMD = 0.28, I² = 62%
> - Between-group Q = 4.12, p = 0.04

### Example 4 · ④ Advanced models: network meta with multiple decisions
**You say:**
> I want to do a network meta with 4 interventions, but I haven't decided whether to use frequentist or Bayesian, and I'm not sure if I should include dose-response

**Assistant replies (sketch):**
> 4 interventions clear. Two key choices to clarify:
>
> **① Which analysis framework?**
> - (a) Frequentist — `netmeta`, inverse-variance based, good for consistent networks
> - (b) Bayesian — `gemtc` (JAGS) or `multinma` (Stan) **local only** (a known coze limitation: the container has no root to install JAGS; on the cloud use (a) netmeta); `bayesmeta` supports Bayesian pairwise comparisons locally
>
> **② Include dose-response?**
> - (a) No — pure pairwise comparison network
> - (b) Yes — needs dose-effect parameters, Bayesian framework preferred
>
> **③ Can't decide?** → say "explain the differences between these choices in detail", and I'll clarify the clinical/statistical meaning before you choose

**📌 Note:** When you've **named the test type but are stuck on "which option / design family"**, the assistant **pops a routing menu** to confirm step by step — instead of deciding for you or dumping the full menu. The menu also offers an "explain the differences" option — when you're unsure, it explains before you decide.

### Example 5 · ⑤ Effect size conversion
**You say:**
> Convert Cohen's d = 0.8 to logOR

**Assistant replies (sketch):**
> ✅ d = 0.8 → logOR ≈ 1.45 (SE ≈ 0.38), based on logOR = d × π/√3

### Example 6 · ⑥ Visualization
**You say:**
> Draw a forest plot, lancet theme

**Assistant replies (sketch):**
> ✅ Forest plot generated (lancet theme, with summary diamond and I² label). [SVG output]

### Example 7 · ⑦ Study quality
**You say:**
> Assess risk of bias with RoB 2.0

**Assistant replies (sketch):**
> ✅ RoB 2.0 assessment complete. Please provide the risk-of-bias judgment (Low / Some concerns / High) for each study — I'll generate the traffic-light plot and stacked summary bar. [SVG output]

## 2. What You Can Do — Scenario Index

Categories are grouped by **workflow stage first, then analysis purpose** (7 below). The systematic-review workflow comes first as the upstream gate, followed by six analysis-purpose categories. Each row gives the typical **clinical scenario** and a line you can **copy verbatim** under "Try saying". The same test may be reached from multiple entry points.

> The underlying R packages (metafor / meta / netmeta …) are listed in Section 6 "Advanced Reference"; ordinary users don't need to care.

## 3. First-Time FAQ

**Q: I only gave effect size and study count, no other parameters — will it still compute?**
A: Yes. Most analyses need only 3 items — effect size (or rate / HR) + α + power. Omitted parts (two-sided α=0.05, 1:1 randomization, follow-up) are filled with sensible defaults; if something truly required is missing, the assistant will ask.

**Q: Is the n in the result per group or total?**
A: By default it's **per group**; paired / crossover designs report per-sequence, and survival often reports total events needed. The output always labels this clearly.

**Q: Does the analysis run as soon as I describe a request?**
A: Yes. Once you describe the request, the assistant **auto-executes** and returns the real numbers + figures — no extra trigger word needed. Computation runs on the cloud coze R engine (data disclosure in Section 5).

**Q: I want the reproducible R code for submission or audit — how do I ask?**
A: Say **"give me the full R code"**. Every analysis returns reproducible R code (with R and package versions), which you can copy, modify, and re-run yourself.

**Q: On a Chinese system, is the output in Chinese?**
A: Yes. By default the output language follows your OS language setting — Chinese on a Chinese-OS, English otherwise. This default requires no extra permission and only affects display language; you can force-switch anytime via a prompt (e.g. "用中文回复" / "switch to English").

**Q: My data is in SPSS/Excel/Stata format — what do I do?**
A: Say **"help me convert my SPSS/Excel data to CSV"** — the assistant will recommend installing `@skill:statdata-transfer` for 50+ format conversions.

**Q: What if my data must stay confidential?**
A: Run the whole analysis with **simulated / placeholder data**, then ask the skill for the **full reproducible R code** and run it yourself locally with your real data. The skill itself only sends your **analysis parameters / summary statistics** (event counts, sample sizes, effect sizes) to the cloud coze R engine — it **never touches your raw datasets or individual-patient records** (unless you explicitly choose to run an IPD analysis through the cloud, in which case sending IPD to the cloud is your decision).

**Q: What if I found an error in the result — how do I report it?**
A: This skill follows the standard bug-report workflow. If you suspect the result is wrong (or the engine errored), just say **"report a bug" / "上报问题" / "提交错误报告"**. The skill also **proactively asks** whether to report when it detects a likely defect (e.g. the engine errors or retries still fail) — at most **once per session**, and you can always decline. Either way, the assistant will:
1. **Propose a sanitized report** (11-field whitelist: skill / skill_version / test / error_type / error_code / engine_status / description / locale / query_origin / session_hash / attempts — **no raw input values or personal data**, except the `description` field where you decide what to disclose, e.g. the algorithm/function used and the error message);
2. **Show the full report text for your review** — you can add a problem description or correct anything before confirming;
3. **Send after your explicit confirmation** — to the unified endpoint `https://ct-bugreport.coze.site/run` (if this session called coze) or, if purely local, **save the sanitized report locally and show you the author contact** so you can email it yourself if you choose (the skill itself does not send it; data never leaves your machine unless you email it);
4. **Receive an acknowledgment** — including whether a previously submitted report from your source has already been fixed (with the fix note) or is still pending.

You stay in full control: the report is shown to you **before** anything is sent, and nothing is transmitted without your explicit "send" confirmation.

---

## 4. Execution Model

- **Auto-execution:** Once you describe a request, the skill **auto-executes** the analysis and returns real numbers + figures — no extra trigger word or confirmation needed. Computation runs on the cloud coze R engine by default.
- **Default compute path:** The skill sends the analysis request to the cloud coze R engine (`https://ct-meta.coze.site/run`) (data disclosure in Section 5).
- **Reproducible code:** Every analysis returns reproducible R code (with R + package versions); say **"give me the full R code"** to obtain it for submission or audit.
- **Outbound authorization:** The default endpoint is pre-approved and runs automatically; a custom endpoint (`COZE_META_ENDPOINT`) asks for confirmation on first use (see Section 5).
- **Output is for reference only** — validate before journal submission or regulatory use.

---

## 5. Data & Privacy

The skill sends data externally in **two** situations: ① when you describe an analysis request, the skill **auto-sends** the analysis request to execute; ② when you confirm sending an error report. **Neither sends personal identifiers.**

**5.1 Analysis request (cloud computation)**
- **What is sent:** your **analysis data** — **summary statistics** such as study event counts / sample sizes / effect sizes. No personal identifiers; payloads are sanitized before sending.
- **When:** the skill **auto-sends** after you describe a request; **before the first outbound call each session**, the skill gives you a one-time spoken disclosure of what is sent and to which endpoint (then executes automatically, without per-call confirmation).
- **Endpoint:** default `https://ct-meta.coze.site/run` (pre-approved in `adapters/config.json` `auto_approve_endpoints`). A custom endpoint (`COZE_META_ENDPOINT`) asks for confirmation on first use (AUTH-BLOCK), and is persisted to the whitelist after you approve.
- **If declined:** the skill returns a clear "cloud analysis not used" message.

**5.2 Metadata sent with the request**
Each request also carries two metadata fields (**in both the analysis request and the error report**):
- `query_origin`: a SHA-256 hash of your machine hostname, used only for server-side attribution / rate-limiting — **not** your plaintext hostname;
- `locale`: your OS language, for bilingual output.

Neither is used to identify you personally.

**5.3 Error report**
- **What is sent:** **only** the 11-key whitelist envelope (skill / skill_version / test / error_type / error_code / engine_status / description / locale / query_origin / session_hash / attempts) — **no analysis data and no personal identifiers**. `description` is the only free-text field, and you review it before consent (hard boundary: no identifiable person/institution/subject info).
- **Endpoint:** unified bug-report endpoint `https://ct-bugreport.coze.site/run`.
- **If declined:** nothing is sent; if there is no cloud call this session, the report is saved locally instead (`save_local_report`, data never leaves the machine).

> **In one sentence:** your **analysis summary data** is **auto-sent** to the cloud after you describe a request (with a one-time disclosure before the first outbound call each session); **error reports** go to the unified endpoint only after your confirmation; the two metadata fields (`query_origin` hash + `locale`) are for anonymous attribution. Raw data and individual records never leave your machine.

## Confidentiality Notice

> The CT series consists of 20+ specialized domain skills, organized into **two tiers — A, B** — by "whether the input contains confidential information" (network / egress / publish are independent orthogonal attributes; see ct-base §11), providing full coverage of the entire new-drug clinical trial (Clinical Trial) lifecycle.
>
> - **Tier A (non-confidential input)**: run fully locally using only ordinary data; Tier A may need external public retrieval but involves no confidential information. These skills are published openly on GitHub.
> - **Tier B (confidential input)**: accept strictly confidential clinical-trial data / protocols / CRFs from pharma sponsors (e.g., ct-analysis, ct-sdtm, ct-protocol, ct-eligibility); Tier B is processed locally and never leaves the boundary (egress=none), or additionally requires policy approval (egress=approval-req, e.g. ct-eligibility). Tier B packages contain zero confidential data but are NOT publicly published (stays fully local) — confidential input never ships with the package or leaves the machine.
